A project to wrangle data from the WeRateDogs twitter account using an API, JSON data from Udacity,
and standard csv data.

The project required identification of quality and tidiness issues and corrective actions, and then exploratory
analysis of the data to build insight into the WeRateDogs tweets.

This cleaning / wrangling is complete for Udacity purposes, but I would like to continue some of the wrangling process
for my own purposes.

Possible to-do's:
1) add regex to capture the gender of the dog's
2) expand the range of clause's used to identify the dog names
3) explore whether more fixes exist for the rating portion, to capture missing or incorrect ratings
4) poke deeper into breed classification system to correct mistakes and provide more descriptive data / visuals
